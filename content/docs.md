Ruma is a set of Rust library crates for working with the Matrix protocol.

This site contains an introduction to Matrix and an overview of the Rust crates
Ruma consists of.

## [Introduction to Matrix](/docs/matrix/)

If you're new to Matrix and want to learn how to use it, this is the place to
start.

Topics include an overview of the protocol, its major features, and a discussion
of what problems it solves.

## [Ruma's crates](/docs/crates/)

Go here to learn about how Ruma's code is structured. This will soon be less
important when *using* Ruma, because we are planning to release one crate that
exposes all of our types and traits from the `ruma` crate, but will stay
relevant if you want to contribute to the project.

## [How to Contribute](/docs/contributing/)

If you're looking to get involved with the project, here is the place to start.
